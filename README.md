### Project Proposal: 
Description:

Discord is a messaging platform designed for building communities that has become increasingly popular amongst students, gamers, and cohorts. Our concept is to design a music player bot, the Best JukeBot, that can function inside any Discord server. This bot will enable users to listen to music pulled from multiple APIs like SoundCloud, YouTube, Bandcamp, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and Vimeo. It will have the basic functionality of a music player: playing, pausing, stopping, repeating, and seeking features. It will also have additional features like a simple interface using PyGui to put the bot online and offline, and post song lyrics and memes.

Project Relevance:

Our project, the Best JukeBot will meet several educational goals of the scope in this class. This will be developed in an object oriented programming language, Python. On-the-fly coding will happen while testing the command functionality of the live bot. Debugging and test driven development will also be practically applied to ensure proper functionality. The bot will access a database of our own creation for our feature of showing statistical data of the songs played in the Discord server. The group will also focus on version control and issue tracking using Github when implementing our feature list.

Expected Contributions:

- Christian M. Davis: 
Features I’ll contribute to are playing music and assigning which library is the primary source for music. I will also manage some of the setup for stretch goals like the database for song statistics and server that will host the bot on Heroku. Readme will be updated with the steps to get an instance of the project working on a user’s own Heroku server.
- Darren Chen: 
I will contribute to the documentation write-ups, including this README.md file. I will also work on the following features: fast forwarding and rewinding, adding to and clearing song queues/playlists, and grabbing songs from (as of yet unspecified) API.
- Ju-Hung Chen: 
I will contribute to grabbing and displaying lyrics, and work on building statistics of total play time. Beside that, I will be reviewing teammates’ code on GitHub and making sure the code properly merges to the main branch. I will frequently update readme and make sure the format meets the requirement.
- Rebecca Robb: 
I will contribute to writing the documentation including the development of the README.md file like formatting and ensuring we meet all requirements. I will also be testing my code as well as my partners throughout the duration of this project. I intend to contribute to the interface and help my partners complete add various feature calls like the several meme features the bot contains like GIFs and random dance alerts.

### Vision:

This is for users of Discord who listen to music from multiple sources. The Better JukeBot
will serve as a music player bot within a Discord server that will allow the user to
play the music from the library of their choosing. Unlike typical music bots which usually 
support just one music source, our bot will allow users to grab music from multiple music
source APIs along with additional moderation and commands.

### Features List:
Feature List (MVP):
- play/pause/stop/repeat/seek
- search from multiple APIs, search from YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, BandCamp, Apple Podcast, and Google Podcast.
- joining server/voice channel to play the music
- simple interface - connect and disconnect
 
Expanded Feature List:
- Display lyrics in text channel
- Song queues
- Memes
- Grab popular playlists
- Standard moderation tools
- Disconnect when voice channel is empty
- Vote to skip song
- *statistics to show how many times song was played in server
- *play local files

**Contributions:**

* Christian M. Davis: Created the user persona, Tony, and the minimal project of the hello world bot for the first week.
    
* Darren Chen: Created the user persona, Barbra.
    
* Ju-Hung Chen: Created the user persona, Akari.
    
* Rebecca Robb: I created the user persona, Elleanna. Developed the vision statement with Christian. I also added the goober command for the initial minimal project. I attempted to use the Apple Music API but was stunted by the fact you needed a paid developer account. From this I decided to use BandCamp API. While troubleshooting the bandcamp API library it worked with the existing code that played our youtube API links.
